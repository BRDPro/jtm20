    "description": "<p>Scaling Agile @ Availity<br/>A year ago, Availity‚Äôs executive leaders asked how our teams can be better aligned with the overall strategy of Availity. Sarah Andres (Enterprise Solutions Architect) and Erwin Alberto (Enterprise Solutions Architect) were tasked with answering this question. Sarah and Erwin quickly realized that lack of alignment was primarily due to how Availity planned as an organization. Although teams planned often, they did so in a very localized way. Since Availity has 30+ teams (product teams and shared enterprise teams) planning in their own silos, it was very difficult to achieve the kind of alignment our leaders were asking for. In order to address this issue, Sarah and Erwin introduced the idea of scaling agile where our teams can be in one ‚ÄúBig Room‚Äù planning all at the same time. Our leaders bought into the idea. In November 2017, we launched our first scaled agile event in Availity and it was a huge success. We just finished our second one this past April and are getting ready to do our third in July.</p> <p>We would like to share with you thier experience in installing and implementing this scaled agile framework in Availity.</p> <p>- 5:30pm - Refreshments and Networking<br/>- 6pm - Presentation</p>",
